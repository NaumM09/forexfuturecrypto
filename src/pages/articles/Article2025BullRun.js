      <p>
        The 2025 bull run is poised to be a transformative event in global markets, with profound implications for investors, businesses, and policymakers. As economies recover from the turbulence of recent years, opportunities for growth abound across industries like renewable energy, technology, and cryptocurrency. However, this bull run also brings unique challenges and risks that investors must navigate carefully.
